          I am a software developer focused primarily on web developement (specifically full stack) with some expirence in
          mobile developement as well. Currently I am residing in Toronto Ontario Canada, but I hope to travel around and
          look for new expirences.

          I started programing when I was 13 years old. It mainly stemed from a passion for video games which turned into a passion to make video game which eventually led me into building software developement.

          I just recently graduated the University of Toronto in 2015 with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science (with primary focus on Electrical and Computer Engineering). 

          In the future I want to continue to learn and develop my skills both technical and non-technical and hope to continue working on fun and exciting projects that will hopefully change the world.
